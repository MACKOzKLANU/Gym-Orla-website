                    It all started in a small attic space. With minimal
                    equipment and a passionate spirit, I began my fitness
                    journey alone. The attic was my sanctuary, a place where I
                    honed my skills and developed my love for fitness.

                    As my dedication grew, so did my aspirations. I realized the
                    attic, though cozy, was limiting. Dreams of a more
                    extensive, professional setup began to take shape. I started
                    planning and saving for a new space that could accommodate
                    more equipment and perhaps a few training partners.

                    By September 2023, I transformed our family garage into a
                    more functional gym. Initially, half of the garage was
                    occupied by a tractor, leaving me with only half the space
                    for my workouts. Despite the limited space, I made the best
                    of what I had, sharing the area with my trusty tractor.

                    By March 2024, as more friends and acquaintances began
                    joining, I knew it was time to take the next step. I managed
                    to clear out the tractor and take over the entire garage.
                    This allowed me to set up more equipment and provide a
                    better training environment for my growing clientele.

                    With the entire garage now dedicated to fitness, I started
                    gaining more clients. The garage gym became well-known for
                    effective workouts and personalized coaching. My investment
                    in more equipment and diverse training programs paid off,
                    and the garage was buzzing with activity.

                    Recognizing the importance of digital presence, I started
                    developing a website and an app for Gym Or≈Ça in November
                    2024. These digital tools will provide clients with easy
                    access to information, booking, and resources, further
                    enhancing their fitness journey.
